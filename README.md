Wordpress-Cleanslate
====================

Clean slate developer setup of Wordpress, allowing for separate development of themes etc.


As part of a spec theme development, I followed a tutorial about how to set up a wordpress development environment for Git.

This is the result, before any work has been started.

I have lost the link to the tutorial, unfortunately.
